## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure EmailJS Account

1. **Sign up or log in to EmailJS**: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/

2. **Create a new Email Service**:
   - Go to Email Services
   - Click "Add New Service"
   - Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Follow the setup instructions
   - Note your **Service ID**

3. **Create an Email Template**:
   - Go to Email Templates
   - Click "Create New Template"
   - Use these template variables in your EmailJS template:
     ```
     To: {{to_email}}
     From: {{from_name}} <{{from_email}}>
     Subject: {{subject}}

     {{message}}
     ```
   - Note your **Template ID**

4. **Get your API Keys**:
   - Go to Account > API Keys
   - Note your **Public Key** and **Private Key**

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file and add your EmailJS credentials:

```env
# EmailJS Configuration
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your-service-id-here
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your-template-id-here
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key-here
EMAILJS_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here

# Cron Secret (for scheduled campaigns)
CRON_SECRET=change-this-to-a-random-secret-string
```

### 3. Set Up Cron Job for Scheduled Campaigns

To process scheduled campaigns, you need to set up a cron job that calls:

```
GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-campaigns
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

**Options:**

**A. Vercel Cron (Recommended for Vercel deployments)**

Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/process-campaigns",
    "schedule": "* * * * *"
  }]
}
```

**B. External Cron Service**

Use services like:
- cron-job.org
- EasyCron
- GitHub Actions

Example GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/cron.yml`):
```yaml
name: Process Scheduled Campaigns
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '* * * * *'  # Every minute
jobs:
  cron:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Call cron endpoint
        run: |
          curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-campaigns \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}"
```

### 4. Restart Your Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Mailing List

1. Navigate to `/mailing-lists`
2. Click "Create Mailing List"
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Click "Create"
5. Click "Manage" to add contacts to the list

### Creating an Email Campaign

1. Navigate to `/email-campaigns`
2. Click "Create Campaign"

**Step 1: Email Content**
- Enter campaign name (internal reference)
- Enter subject line (supports variables like {{firstName}})
- Enter email body (HTML supported)
- Optionally select an email template
- Customize from name and email

**Step 2: Select Recipients**
- Choose to use a mailing list OR select individual contacts
- If using mailing list, select from dropdown
- If selecting contacts, check the contacts you want

**Step 3: Send or Schedule**
- Choose "Send Immediately" or "Schedule for Later"
- If scheduling, select date and time
- Review campaign summary
- Click "Create & Send" or "Create & Schedule"

### Variable Replacement

Use these variables in your subject and body:

- `{{firstName}}` - Contact's first name
- `{{lastName}}` - Contact's last name
- `{{name}}` - Contact's full name
- `{{email}}` - Contact's email
- `{{accountName}}` - Contact's account name

Example:
```html
<p>Hi {{firstName}},</p>
<p>Thank you for being a valued customer at {{accountName}}.</p>
```

### Monitoring Campaign Status

1. Navigate to `/email-campaigns`
2. Click on a campaign to view details
3. See recipient-level status:
   - **PENDING**: Not sent yet
   - **SENT**: Successfully sent
   - **FAILED**: Send failed (error message shown)
   - **BOUNCED**: Email bounced

### Campaign Status Meanings

- **DRAFT**: Campaign created but not sent
- **SCHEDULED**: Campaign scheduled for future send
- **SENDING**: Campaign currently being sent
- **SENT**: Campaign completed sending
- **FAILED**: Campaign failed to send
- **CANCELLED**: Scheduled campaign was cancelled

## Email Rate Limiting

The system includes a 1-second delay between emails to respect EmailJS rate limits. For large campaigns:

- 100 recipients = ~1.7 minutes
- 500 recipients = ~8.3 minutes
- 1000 recipients = ~16.7 minutes

You can adjust this in `app/lib/emailService.ts` (the `delayMs` parameter in `sendBulkEmails`).

## Navigation

Add links to your navigation menu:

```tsx
<Link href="/mailing-lists">Mailing Lists</Link>
<Link href="/email-campaigns">Email Campaigns</Link>
```

## Testing

### Test Campaign Workflow

1. Create a test mailing list with your own email
2. Create a test campaign:
   - Name: "Test Campaign"
   - Subject: "Hello {{firstName}}"
   - Body: "<p>Hi {{firstName}}, this is a test email from {{accountName}}.</p>"
   - Recipients: Your test mailing list
   - Send immediately

3. Check your email to verify:
   - Variables are replaced correctly
   - From address is info@pennjets.com
   - Email formatting looks correct

4. View the campaign in the dashboard to see send status

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. **Check EmailJS credentials** in `.env`
2. **Verify EmailJS template** has correct variable mapping
3. **Check EmailJS dashboard** for error logs
4. **Check browser console** and server logs for errors
5. **Verify contacts have email addresses** (contacts without emails are skipped)

### Scheduled Campaigns Not Sending

1. **Verify cron job is running** and calling the endpoint
2. **Check CRON_SECRET** is set correctly
3. **Check server logs** for cron execution
4. **Verify scheduledFor date** is in the past

### Variables Not Replacing

1. **Ensure contacts have the required fields** (firstName, lastName, etc.)
2. **Use correct variable syntax**: `{{firstName}}` not `{firstName}`
3. **Check EmailJS template** is passing through the `message` variable
